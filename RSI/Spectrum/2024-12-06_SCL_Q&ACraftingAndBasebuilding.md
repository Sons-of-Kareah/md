# Star Citizen Live: Crafting and Basebuilding Q&A - 12/6/24

## Crafting

- **How does crafting change existing gathering methods like mining and salvage?**
> The short version is the mining we have now will change more drastically again and salvage will be getting some changes too. On the mining side we are adding quality to minables; with the system we have now with multiple resources per rock that doesn't make as much sense because you might be looking for quality and not -just- the resources, so we're going to be more bespoke minables like 'the copper rock, the iron rock,' etc. with more of an emphasis on looking for the quality of material instead of combination of materials. We also want to utilize the new planet tech so that these minables are distributed more meaningfully across biomes and landmarks like rivers.

> We will also be more concrete on the minables you find based on the profession you picked; if you're a ship miner you'll find ship minables, if you're an FPS miner you'll find FPS minables, if you're a ground vehicle minable, etc.; these minerals won't be shared across mining types, you'll need to pursue different minerals through different styles of mining; ship, FPS, ground vehicle or base extractors.

> Salvage will also get a revisit; what we're going to do there is construction materials will be constituted of actual normal metals/materials; there will be processes to separate them out, but it's something we're still working on the exact details of. Basically, it will tie into the 'dismantling' side of crafting; when you disassemble something you get back some of the specific materials that went into it, and this is basically how salvage will work with your ship being a mobile dismantler.

- **So basically if I'm looking to craft ships and I need material for the hull, I can do hull scraping and get some of the materials I need for that?**
> There will be some materials you won't get back, though, some materials are volatile or exclusive in some way, so if you just turn around and salvage a ship you just made you won't get those volatiles back.

- **Will there be limited-use blueprints?**
> Yes, we'll be supporting both finite-use blueprints and blueprints that have a cooldown between uses just to give us extra ways of balancing.

- **Can you trade blueprints?**
> Yes and no; we mentioned at citcon that blueprints can be credited directly to your character. So if you get a directly attributed blueprint like from a mission or rep reward, it's bound to your character and you can't trade it, but there will be lootable datapad blueprints in some other areas, and you can trade those datapads before you download the blueprint, but it's a one-time use.

- **Can we use stolen materials to craft?**
> Absolutely; the crafter doesn't care about the legality. You can probably steal an item, dismantle it and use the materials-- that's actually the recommended loop if you steal something; items have ownership flags and you either go through a process of removing that flag, or you simply dismantle it into materials and use those.

- **If you pledge for a ship will you receive a blueprint to craft it?**
> No. If you buy a car from the dealer it doesn't give you the right to make that car; if you buy a ship it gives you the ship. Once you've got a ship, however you got it, you will be able to upgrade it. You can't directly craft a high tier ship but you can upgrade the one you pledged for with in game materials, research, etc.
   
## Crafting - Upgrades

-  **How does the upgrade system work, what are tier 1-5, are they the same or different for every ship or customizable?**
> The current plan is that there's different kinds of blueprint. Most will be upgradeable through research and different kinds will get different benefits through research; a refining blueprint will get more efficient, a repair blueprint will repair more effectively. The creation blueprint is tiered, where a higher tier blueprint lets you create a higher tier item. If you have the tier 1 blueprint for a gun it will have stats for things like fire rate, recoil, etc.; you'll be able to see the range for those stat types, and the exact value of those stats you get when you craft it will be dependent on the quality of the resources you used.

> When you upgrade the blueprint to tier two, those stat ranges will be shifted; a higher top end and low end, with the end result being dependent on the material quality, but better overall than the tier 1. Blueprints also have 'aspects,' so materials put into the grip of a gun might impact the felt recoil but not the fire rate. With the highest tier of creation blueprints, you'll get a choice of what materials go into what aspects of the item so you might be able to more precisely tune for specific stats depending on what resources you add.

> The only other kind of blueprint is the upgrade blueprint itself; if you use an upgrade blueprint to increase the tier of an existing item, the item's original materials don't matter anymore, only the grade of materials you put into the upgrade process will impact the stats. This is to make sure that a Tier 3 item ends up in the same ranges regardless of whether you upgraded it from T1, T2 to T3 or crafted it directly as a tier 3 item.

-  **And these processes don't apply just to gun but to ships too?**
> Right, and also things like ship components.
- **If you take an Aurora and you've upgraded it to Tier 5, and done the same thing with the weapons and the components, you can have an Aurora that is dramatically different than David's Aurora or Pete's Aurora?**
> Yes. One of the big challenges is going to be balancing all the variations you have access to; instead of one ship having certain values, there's going to be a whole range of values that can apply even to any one type of ship.

## Land Claims

- **What's our current plan for land claims?**
> For basic land acquisition, you have general plots, prospecting plots that are smaller/cheaper. You can modify the bounds of these claims, make them bigger and adjust the dimensions which will affect the price. Where the beacon (from old Pioneer pledges) comes in you skip the initial UEC cost for claiming, but there'll still be a recurring UEC tax. If you fail to pay that tax over a period of time you'll begin to lose rights to your base, eventually you'll lose complete ownership of the base and the land, they can be looted or someone else can buy it up. It's important that we avoid the concept of a 'dead' base where people are gone for a year and just keep it forever.

> In addition to that there will be limitations with basically 'national park' areas in lawful and lawless areas; this allows us to reserve areas that's pristine for exploration, resource gathering, etc. When you have a plot of land there will be an exclusion zone around it where no one else can buy or build so you can't get boxed in; that's the current high level summary of the plan.

## Base Building - General Mechanics

- **What can player bases be used for? How will basebuilding integrate with features like mining and trading?**
> Base building will enable us to change the universe and how players interact with one another (or avoid interacting). Even if you don't want to interact with it directly, you'll still be involved with the gameplay loops. For example, maybe you're just a small miner who just wants to make a living out of shipping your resources; for you it might be good to have a base nearby the mining resources to be more efficient. We're trying to keep the possibilities as open as possible; maybe you have storehouses tucked away where you hide stuff, maybe it's something big for your org or a base dedicated to the most efficient refining.

> A base can be used for whatever you want to use it for and will be able to link into any kind of gameplay you're doing, almost every gameplay feature will have representations in the basebuilding feature, and even if you don't have your own base you'll still be visiting other player bases for interactions and economic reasons.

- **What's our current plan for how planetary shields work in high vs low security systems?**
> If a planet has planetary shielding you aren't vulnerable to attack, your stuff can't be stolen; there's two layers, there's air shields which prevent bombardments and shields that hug the buildings themselves and can also block attacks from the ground; in lawless systems like Pyro this is dependent on the 'credit' system and the battle over access to shields week to week but it always applies in lawful systems.

- **You mentioned the idea of multiple or mobile bases; you may have a 'home' base but for industrial purposes there's more of a gameplay style of creating smaller more mobile bases that move around as needed?**
> You can still have your static home base but once your resources there run dry you can disassemble your extractors and go find resources elsewhere; if you want to stay for your home, stay, but you'll need to follow finite resources as well.

- **That leads into: can we deconstruct buildings and how does it work?**
> Yes; through the same AR mode with drones as you use for construction. If you disassemble a base, the drones will put the resources into your freight elevator network. You'll get some of the resources back from disassembling, but not 1:1 with what you put in to begin with.

- **How customizable will bases be in terms of material, color, shape?**
> We really want to make sure they can make the base their own, so that you can tint or put logos on the sides that can personalize it or keep it more low key depending on your goals like hiding a discreet gathering base or advertising a trading post. Something we showed in basebuilding as well is that a majority of buildings will connect with one another; there's generic buildings that can be used for different purposes and tinted and then connected via corridors or otherwise to other generic or more specialized structures.

- **Will there be different architecture styles?**
> For now we're very focused on the high tech visual very well, we have a specific set in mind we want to release with, after that there's more functionality we want to look at, and then we'll be asking if we want to expand the high tech set or do we want to build a new set? But we'll be making that decision after seeing how players react to the initial set.

- **How will we be able to decorate in a way that there isn't physics jank all over the place?**
> Decorator AR will let you maglock your furniture into place so that only you or people with the right permissions are allowed to move that object. The initial release will be mainly about building your bases, then we'll move more into the pvp side of things.
   
- **Can you work together to create a base or charge a fee for using a base's services?**
> Yes; we're trying to make it very open. You'll be able to build small or maybe larger bases alone and then you can also team up and build bases quicker or bigger by working in groups. You can also build infrastructure and have people pay to use it; letting people to pay to utilize your high end crafting or refining equipment, etc. You can be primarily a miner, for example, but then go to a player's base that's specialized towards refining and utilize their infrastructure for that.

- **Can you spawn in your base or group bedlog?**
> Yes, but you'll need the proper building for that; if you have a proper medbed/hospital in your base you can use it like other spawn locations w/ imprints.

- **Bases in caves?**
> Not on our roadmap

- **How well will bases blend into the surrounding environment?**
> Tinting will let you blend your buildings better to the environments; you can build near trees (although building on top of trees will remove them). There will also be buildings that can reduce the signature of your base to hide it from scans. 

- **How will player trading at bases work?**
> The seller can place items into the freight elevator and connect them to a terminal or a physical shop and there'll be a mobiglas app where you can advertise what goods you have for sale. As a buyer you can browse listings on this app, or if you need something really specific you can put in a buy order to have people make the exact things you need and deliver them to where they're needed.
   
## Base Building - Resource Extraction

- **Will mining extractors and other processors automatically eject boxes, allowing anyone to tractor them away?**
> There's lots of different crafting machines that do their processes differently but most will have an internal buffer until you're ready to pick them up, but you can also have them directly put stuff in boxes. Either way, they're subject to the same permissions as anything else in your base wrt defenses, etc. so that they can't just be stolen by anyone who walks in. There will also be options to send things directly to your local freight elevator/warehouse at the base.

- **Will underground mining deposits respawn over time and how's the rarity of minerals accounted for in the economy?**
> Short answer is yes, they will respawn, but it's very unlikely they'll respawn in the exact spot you already have. What we want to see is people moving around to new locations to grab new resources. As to the latter, it's a big concern; we have to work very closely with the economy team to make sure that there's both a healthy in-game economy driven by us and also a player driven economy that are functional.

## Base Building - Space Stations

- **Where can space stations be build and will there be smaller ones for small groups?**
> There currently aren't plans for smaller scale space stations. There will be some limitations on where you can build a space station but you're not limited to orbit around a planet, you can build it out in the depths of space and have it hidden. Space stations won't be physically smaller but it isn't set in stone yet how big of a group would be needed to tackle that project.

## Base Building - Restrictions/Networking & Shard Issues

- **How does all this work with shards?**
> The plan is that every base/plot of land/extraction point will be visible across all shards within a region. If I set up a base and set up shop people from other shards in that region will be able to visit and interact with it, but raiding can only occur on one shard. This is a bit tricky and will involve a bit of a ruleset; the easiest part is 'is the owner online,' and if so, the raid can only occur on that shard where the owner is present; if I'm on the wrong shard and I attempt a raid I'll receive a prompt that I need to change shards to do that. Obviously as shards grow and we have fewer of them we'll see that issue less, but you'll never be in a scenario where you can't defend your base because someone attacks it on a different shard.

- **So if you're offline or in a different shard your base is just a visual replica?**
> Well yes, but people can still use and interact with it, shops will still be functioning and that kind of thing, it's just when it comes to attacking it has to occur on a single shard.

- **What will this look like in terms of offline raiding and base defenses? If I don't log in is my stuff always safe, is there a decay timer, etc.**
> If you are in a lawless area and you haven't secured the shield tech from the prior week's station warfare then you're open to be raided whether you're online or offline; you can create defenses to deter that including shielding so they have to do a ground assault. You can also haul your valuables to a safer area if you're going to be gone for a while.

- **Can you start a construction project with drones from our Starlancer and leave?**
> Once you set the building in motion you can leave, log off, etc. and the drone will do its job; if the build finishes the drone will try to return to its mothership, if it can't then the drone will self-destruct and you'll need another drone, but you can get one just by repairing the Starlancer. 

-  **What happens if people park their Idris or otherwise obstruct an area where you have your drones trying to build something?**
> That's not going to be possible; the construction hologram is physicalized and will be blocked off so someone can't land a ship there.

- **Is terrain manipulation all automated?**
> We don't want players to completely change the terrain to their liking, but there will be buildings that can do light terrain manipulation to make sure staircases work, but generally you'll use the foundation tiles to flatten area and then build on top of foundations when terrain is difficult.
